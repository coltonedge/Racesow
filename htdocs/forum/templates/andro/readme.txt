Instructions for installing this theme:


1. Unzip all the files into a folder called 'andro'.  You'll notice there are several .zip files inside the main .zip file.  These represent folders that should exist inside the folder andro.  You should have an admin folder, and images folder, and an images/lang_english folder (the lang_english.zip is inside the images.zip).  MAKE SURE you put those files in the correct  folder!  Otherwise, the theme won't know where to look for certian files.  It's easiest simply to create a folder on your desktop to unzip all the files into, then upload them to your server with an FTP program.  When you upload things to your server, you'll need to create a folder under the 'templates' folder called 'andro'.  It MUST be called andro, otherwise, it won't work! ^_^;

2. Go to your Admin panel, and on the side under Styles click Add.  The andro theme should be listed, and a link saying 'add' next to it.  Click the link.

3. To set that theme as the default theme, go under General Admin to the side and click Configuration.  There's a dropdown box that lets you set a Default Style.

All that I ask is that you PLEASE redo the title image to the name of your board.  While it's true I don't have that board running at the moment, I am keeping it up because I have plans for it in the future.  If you'd like me to make a replacement title image for you, just email me at 'dubird@ancientclan.net' and ask.  It's a simple change, so I don't mind doing it.  Hope you enjoy this theme!

# Version history
#

1.1.1:
	Optimized the code in the functions page. Added more functions for more flexibility/options.

1.1.0:
	First major revision.
	Moved the code into one single file, and made functions for everything, making the whole system
	portable to any page in your phpBB.

0.9.5:
	Cleaned up the code a bit. Removed the options of listing the buddylist. Hidden users are now always
	shown in 'offline', unless you are an admin.

0.9.4:
	Redirects when a post id is specified when viewing a topic and adding/removing a buddy, adds the anchor
	in the right place.
	All files have now been placed in the 'phpbb_root_path' folder. This to make it easier to see where all
	files go.

	Fixed a bug with the online status of users. Seems I need glasses :o/

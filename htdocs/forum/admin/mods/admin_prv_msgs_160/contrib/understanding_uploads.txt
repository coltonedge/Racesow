This will walk you through understanding the uploads section of the template,
since it can appear vague to a new mod installer.

Let us step through an example:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#-----[ UPLOAD ]------------------------------------------ 
#   If you are having trouble understanding this section, read
#   the goodies/understanding_upload.txt file.
#
copy install/*.* to install/
copy admin/*.* to admin/
copy test.php to /
copy templates/subSilver/admin/*.* to templates/subSilver/admin/
copy language/lang_english/*.* to language/lang_english/
copy includes/*.* to includes/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will see lots of dir/*.* to dir/ above.  It actually means that inside
the directory structure of the hack you are installing, you will find, for example
the install directory.  Inside this directory will be several files, which all needs
to be uploaded to your site.  If it does not already exist, you would need to
create the install sub-directory on your site, such as phpBB2/install.  You would
upload all the files inside the local install directory to the one on your site.

If you see a single / as the upload location, it simply means your main phpBB
directory.  Such as phpBB2/.

Some areas will be using the default names, such as templates and languages.  Here
you should substitute your directory if you use something different.  For example,
say you use a template scheme called copperX.  You would instead of the line
templates/subSilver/admin/*.* to templates/subSilver/admin/ assume it is meant
templates/subSilver/admin/*.* to templates/copperX/admin/ instead.

Languages are different, as my hacks most likely will not include any other than
English unless someone has contributed them to me.  You can of course use the
default English text for all languages on your site until you can translate them
yourself or find one that is translated.  To do so, for the line
language/lang_english/*.* to language/lang_english/ you would assume for each
language/lang_english/*.* to language/lang_german/,
language/lang_english/*.* to language/lang_french/, and so forth.  If there is
an included language other than english, it will exist under the same
structure like language/lang_german/*.* locally.

WORLDSPAWN ENTITY

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED worldspawn (0 0 0) ?
Only used for the world. (updated: 12/08/2005)
-------- KEYS --------
message : text to print at user logon. Used for name of level.
music : path/name of looping .wav file used for level's music (eg. music/sonic5.wav).
ambient : Adds a constant value to overall lighting. Use is not recommended. Ambient light will have a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.
gravity : gravity of level (default is normal gravity: 800).
_color : RGB value for ambient light color (default is 0 0 0).
_keeplights : Keep light entities in the BSP. Normally stripped out by the BSP process and read from the .map file by the lighting phase (Warsow needs this to be set to 1!).
gridsize : granularity of the lightgrid created by q3map. Value is three integers separated by spaces, representing number of units between grid points in X Y Z. Default gridsize value is 128 128 256. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.
_blocksize : q3map always splits the BSP tree along the planes X=_blocksize*n and Y=_blocksize*n. Default _blocksize value is 1024. Increase the blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times on very large maps with a low structural brush density.*/

/*QUAKED weapon_shockwave (1 0 .5) (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 48) SUSPENDED
Shockwave (todo) (updated: 12/08/2005)
-------- KEYS --------
target : activating this entity will trigger any entity with this as targetname.
targetname : name to use for targeting this entity.
wait : time in seconds before item spawns for the first time in the map (todo)
team : set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notduel : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes. (todo)
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes. 
notctf : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes. (todo)
notbot : used to make an item invisible for bot attraction. (todo)
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SUSPENDED : item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.
In Warsow, "wait" will be understood only as delay for spawning the item once the map starts. Respawn item times depend on the gametype and can't be selected by the mapper.

-------- KEYS --------
alphamap : this is the path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
layers : this integer value is the number unique root shaders that will be use on the terrain.
shader : this is the path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity.
terrain : this is an on/off flag. When set to 1, the entity becomes a terrain entity.

The TAB key can be used to flip through the component pieces of a selected func_group entity, isolating individual components. To make a func_group into a terrain entity, refer to the Terrain Construction documentation.*/

-------- KEYS --------
speed : amount of time in seconds for one complete oscillation cycle (default 4).
height : sets the amount of travel of the oscillation movement (default 32). 
phase : sets the start offset of the oscillation cycle. Values must be 0 < phase < 1. Any integer phase value is the same as no offset (default 0).
noise_start : start moving sound (default is silent)
noise : path/name of .wav file to play (default is silent). Use looping sounds only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav - See Notes).
noise_stop : stop moving sound (default is silent)
model2 : path/name of model to include.
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of sound and .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).

-------- NOTES --------
In order for the sound to be emitted from the entity, it is recommended to include a brush with an origin shader at its center, otherwise the sound will not follow the entity as it moves. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

-------- KEYS --------
angle : determines the direction in which the button will move (up = -1, down = -2).

You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. Solid entity that describes a pendulum back and forth rotation movement. Rotates on the X axis by default.

You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. Pendulum will rotate along the X axis by default. Very crude operation: pendulum cannot rotate along Z axis, the speed of swing (frequency) is not adjustable. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value. Pendulums always swing north / south on unrotated models. Add an angles field to the model to allow rotation in other directions. Pendulum frequency is a physical constant based on the length of the beam and gravity.*/

Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off. (updated: 12/08/2005)
-------- KEYS --------
speed : determines how fast the plat moves (default 300).

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
LOW_TRIGGER : &1 the plat is triggered from its lower side
-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

Normal sounds play each time the target is used.  The reliable flag can be set for crucial voiceovers. Looped sounds are always atten 3 / vol 1, and the use function toggles it on/off. Multiple identical looping sounds will just increase volume without any speed cost. (updated: 12/08/2005)

ACTIVATOR : &16 sound will play only for the player that activated the target.
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.*/
